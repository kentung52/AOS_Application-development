Advanced Operating System Project - BudgetManager


This project involves the development of a customized application aimed at helping users
manage their daily budgeting and expenses while gaining insights into their spending habits.

The application offers users comprehensive recording features, allowing them to log daily
expenses. It automatically categorizes expenses based on their type while also supporting
manual addition of expense categories. Additionally, it calculates and displays the total
income and expenses for the current month.

The app provides budget-setting and savings goal features to help users maintain financial balance.

It also includes a monthly income and expense report analysis feature, which automatically generates
charts and detailed transaction lists. This makes it easier for users to observe their spending
patterns for the entire month. Furthermore, the application offers AI-generated analysis reports
to assist users in improving their spending habits.
